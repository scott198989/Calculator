                        calculator app

## Introduction

A calculator app that I have built using React.js.  Still a little bit of work in progress as far as styling goes, would like to group numbers on one side and scientific notation buttons on another.  

## Features

You can use this just like any other calculator that you have used before!  

## Dependencies

If using homebrew:

brew update

brew install yarn

yarn start
