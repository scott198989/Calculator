## Introduction

This is a calculator app built using React.js. It's still a work in progressâ€”I'm planning on grouping numbers on one side and scientific notation buttons on another.

## Features

- Standard Calculations: Perform basic addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
  
## Technologies

- React.js
- Yarn

## Installation

To run this app locally, you'll need Yarn. If you don't have it, you can install it via Homebrew:

```bash
brew update
brew install yarn
```

Then, clone the repository and run the following commands:

```bash
yarn install
yarn start
```

This will install all dependencies and start the development server.

## Usage

To use the calculator, simply click the numbers and operators as you would with any standard calculator.

## Future Improvements

- Grouping of scientific notation buttons
- Enhanced styling

## Contributing

Feel free to fork the repo and submit pull requests for any enhancements, bug fixes, or other contributions you have in mind.
